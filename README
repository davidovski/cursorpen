# Cursor Pen

A simple tool for X11 to use your trackpad with absolute positioning. Allows your trackpad to be used as if it were a graphical tablet, provided that you have a stylus that it can recognise.

## Build requirements

- C compiler
- make
- libx11 (including headers)
- libxtst
- libxi
- libudev
- libevdev

## Usage

Build this project using `make`, and run the created binary file `./cursorpen`

The tool should automatically detect your trackpad device and while it is running, any touch to the trackpad should be automatically detected.

Depending on your trackpad, you may be able to use a standard touchscreen stylus to "draw".

## Project TODO

- Configure screen area
- Allow screen selection
- Disable device's default drivers (works without this, but will provide a smoother experience)
- Integrate better into the desktop, ie as some sort of service
- Reduce jagged edges when drawing
- Optimise?
